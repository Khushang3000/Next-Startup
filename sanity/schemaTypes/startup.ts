//if we want a nested type like maybe inside startup we want the author of the startup to go (IN CASE WE DON'T HAVE AN AUTHOR TYPE!!!), 
//in the fields of that startup's defineType, we could add something like this.

// title: "Author",
// type: "document",

// name: "author_name",
// type: "string"})]})})

//also there's another way, if we want to perform nesting then we can use the object type
