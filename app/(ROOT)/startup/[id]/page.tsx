    //let's go to studio then vision, there we can modify our query a bit to now not fetch all the startups, but rather fetch a single startup's details
    
    // it'll look like this below, where a type is startup and _id == $id(this $id is the id that is passed through params and in sanity studio's vision you can pass this param in the params tab), and [0] means give me only the element that matches that query.
    //if you copy and pass the id that you got on the startup details page then you'd get the result as null, because it got parsed to show nicely on the ui
    //to get the real id, go into structure then startup then click on the startup that we have, click 3dots and from there inspect it and you'll get the id, copy it and pass that as a param in the vision
    //make sure to pass that id in string. now run fetch from vision tab.

    //the id we get here is actually parsed which our sanity groqq can't read. so we gotta convert it.
    //hey me from the future: that problem was cuz when we were clicking on the details link from the startupcard, we actually added an extra } to the string that's why 
    //our string wasn't the one that we were expecting, and same case happened when we passed the same string in params of vision for the first time!!!

          now you can provide object-cover classname to that Image tag to make sure that image keeps the aspect ratio and fills the container(there are other properties like object-fit contain wrap nowrap overflow that you can learn about later somewhere)
          also, either you can provide height and width properties on the Image tag, to give custom height and width, i prefer to provide fill properties as it makes the 
          image tag's image fill the container containing it.
          also, giving width and height in vw and vh are better in most cases as they ALWAYS work, even if you don't wanna use them, you can try seeing what they do and then use what way you want to provide width and height manually
          like rem % px, n more.
          another thing, flex has defauld direction row-> so justify there makes content move (in main origin)left-right(horizontally), align moves content (in cross-origin)vertically(top-bottom)
          flex-col is exactly opposite as then the main and cross origins are swapped
          so justify still moves on main origin but main origin is (top-bottom)vertical now, similarly align moves on cross-origin which is horizontal now(left-right.)
          we can also provide how many elements we want in the main origin, like flex-row-4 so 4 elements per row only. */}

            {/* NOW THIS WORKS FINE, but we have a little issue, and that is that we gotta be aware of two different data fetching patterns, parallel and sequential
            
            With sequential data fetching, requests in a route are dependent on each other and therefore create waterfalls. There may be cases where you want this pattern because one fetch depends on the result of the other, or you want a condition to be satisfied before the next fetch to save resources. However, this behavior can also be unintentional and lead to longer loading times.
            
            With parallel data fetching, requests in a route are eagerly initiated and will load data at the same time. This reduces client-server waterfalls and the total time it takes to load data.
            
            basically in sequential, one is happening after the previous one is finished, and in parallel, multiple go at once and some go sequentially.
            what we did just now was sequential. as we're first fetching the data about the post and only then we're fetching the editor posts.
            but the time to fetch the data will be increased as it will be the sum of both the requests, this is best if the second request depends on the first one.
            //REMEMBER: I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BOTH CLIENT.FETCH CALLS.
            BUT AS you know that these two fetches are completely independent, so we can take advantage of these mordern systems that are capable of handling multiple requests at the same time(concurrently)
            we do it like:
            const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([url1, url2])
            //like this you can achieve parallel data fetching and you can pass as many arguments as you want. */}

      when you wanna add a dynamic block, you need to wrap it within a <Suspense> tag comming from react. where we can also provide fallback in case we can not render something new, or to show something while that real content hasn't been fetched.
      so for that placeholder we'll use a Skeleton tag comming from shadcn, install it by npx shadcn@latest add skeleton */}
