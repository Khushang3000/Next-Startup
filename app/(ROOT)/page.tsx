//Now we'll use sanity, but what is sanity?
// Sanity is a headless CMS (content management system).
// Headless = it doesnâ€™t control your frontend (UI), only the content.
// You get a hosted backend + APIs + an admin dashboard (Sanity Studio) where you or non-devs can manage content (posts, products, categories, users, etc.).

//it goes well with nextjs, and you can hand it to your clients for whom you're building the app, and they handle the content.
//in sanity, we can build a whole operating system around the content, you'll have a content workspace/studio for your application that you can hand over to your client, so they can manage it as well
//and that studio is built on top of powerful apis that allow you to customize the way you create and manage your content, and they even store it for ya.

//by integrating and deploying sanity with vercel, we can achieve excellent performance metrics, and following features:
//merged changes instantly go live on their global edge network
//SSL encryption, asset compression, and cache invalidation are also provided
//we'll go for the free plan. go on the sanity home page, click start building, signIn.
//create a project.
//make sure to create a clean project where you aren't importing any schema from somewhere else.

// create a new studio with sanity cli:
// npm create sanity@latest -- --project xr24oz99 --dataset production --template clean --typescript --output-path studio-next_startup
//add config files in the nextjs folder.
//embed sanity studio
//add projectid and dataset to env.local

//install the latest version of sanity, to use the live api feature they offer.
//npm i next-sanity@canary

// now you'll see there have been multiple files and folder generated for us.
//lets see the sanity cli.ts, next let's see sanityconfig.ts
// cd studio-next_startup
