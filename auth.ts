                        // If you pass id, it will just become a normal field, not the documentâ€™s identifier.

        name: name,

    // Now after a successful signIn we'd need to create a author id from sanity to use it for our profile or creating a startup.
    //let's do that by modifying the jwt token., we can do that by creating a second callback. we'll do that in the next commit.

//Now we'll have to make a route handler under app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts   (dynamic route).
